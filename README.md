:zap: CoinBlock blocks services like CoinHive from using your browser to mine cryptocurrency without your consent.

### What?
CoinBlock is a browser extention that blocks requests to browser mining services.  It currently works in the chrome browser, with support for other browsers on the way.

### Why?
recently, some sites have turned to cryptocurrency mining for revenue.  While not inheritly evil, I belive that mining without the users consent is wrong.
#### Mining in your browser:
+ can consume huge amounts of resources
+ can slow down your browser
+ makes for a negative browsering expirence

### How?
#### Use:
+ Install the extention for your browser of choice
+ Load the source as an unpacked extention
#### Contribute:
+ A bug or bugfix
+ Feature requests
+ Blacklist updates
